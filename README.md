### Hi there 👋
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=MohammedAl-Rasheed)
## 💻 What I'm up to...
- 🔨 I'm working on a non-profit side-project that should be able to help all Ontario grade 12 students have an assistant they can rely on for next year. I plan on creating a learning managment system in regards on all ontario grade 12 university level courses such as Advanced Functions(MHF4U), Calculus and Vectors(MCV4U) etc. This platform will cary on notes and resources for every single part of the course you wish for. 
- 🔨 Currently co-developing a side-project called Crypto Venture Tracker. Crypto Venture Tracker is a web application that aggregates data related to the investments of cryptocurrency exchanges and presents them in a digestible manner for the average cryptocurrency investor to get an idea of what cryptocurrency exchanges are up to.
## 🎯 What I plan to work on in the near future

- ✍️ Get better knowledge within the world of Data Structures and Algorithms
- 📖 Learn more about Binary Exploitation and compete in more CTF's
